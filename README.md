# [Remote Document Access](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/SIRS/2021-2022/1-semestre)

Remote Document Access was a project developed within the scope of the Network and Computer Security (SIRS) course.

With this application, it is possible to securely store files in the drive and share them with any number of chosen collaborators. All file upload, download, and sharing operations are securely performed. Additionally, this program also includes a version control mechanism where it is possible to retrieve older versions of the files uploaded by us to the system.

Remote Document Access was evaluated by Professors Miguel Pardal and Ricardo Chaves, and by Professor David Rogério de Matos, at the time a Ph.D. candidate. It was also scrutinized in a project presentation session by Professors Miguel Pardal and David Rogério de Matos.

This project received a score of 20/20. It was not only one of only two 20/20 scores at the Instituto Superior Técnico in the 1st Semester of 2018/2019 in the SIRS course, but it was also recognized as the best project in the entire university. This accomplishment is particularly notable given the rigorous nature of the course.

The conception of Remote Document Access was due to the work of these two group members:

- 82014 - João Meira (MEIC-T) - Final Grade in the course: (18/20) @ [João Meira's GitHub](https://github.com/meiraxx)
- 82069 - José Brás  (MEIC-T) - Final Grade in the course: (17/20) @ [José Brás' GitHub](https://github.com/ist182069)

It is with great pleasure that we share this project freely through this public repository so that others may draw inspiration from it and assist future SIRS students in completing their respective projects.
